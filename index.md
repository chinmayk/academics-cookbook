# Angostura Chai
Life's too short to not have great chai. Or is it too short to make great chai? No one knows. Anyway, here's one hack. Make chai (1 tsp black tea brewed in half a cup of water at 95C/200F; add half cup boiled milk; half tsp of sugar). Then add two splashes of Angostura bitters. 

Very interesting. 

# The Antidote

A cocktail for our troubled Coronavirus times. From my philosopher friend.

* 3 parts rye whiskey
* 1/2 part Anisette
* 1/2 part Triple-Sec
* 1/2 lemon
* 1 Tbsp maple syrup

Shake over ice. Garnish with lemon peel, and star anise, if you have some handy.

_Note: it's somewhat sweeter than I'd like, and very boozy._
